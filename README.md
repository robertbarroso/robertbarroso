## Hiya! ^-^

I'm a Computer Science Student @ **Oregon State University**.
I am an aspiring software engineer with an interest in software development. 

### I'm currently working on...
> A small, light-weight tool for content creators that will allow them to create fun and engaging experiences with their audiences!
> Currently being developed in JavaScript with Node.js and React.

### I'm currently learning...
> Currently learning web development and low-level programming. At the moment, I am enamored by low-level and still learning how I can utilize in the tools I like to make!
