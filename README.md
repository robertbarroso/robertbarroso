### 🤔 My history...
> Once a marketing designer, now turned back to pursue what I wanted to originally - computer software and hardware engineering. A product of burnout, my choice to delve into marketing and design was one of wanting to breath from tons of stress at the time. Now after some time, I think now is the perfect momeent to return to a field I once loved - and still do - with a new mindset and free from burnout.
